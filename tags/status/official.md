# Official Integrations

MCP servers that are officially maintained by the companies behind the products/services they integrate with.

## Description

Official integrations are MCP servers that are developed and maintained by the same companies that create the products or services they connect to. These servers typically offer more reliable and comprehensive access to the underlying APIs and are more likely to stay up-to-date with changes.

## Examples

- Cloudflare MCP Server (by Cloudflare)
- Stripe Agent Toolkit (by Stripe)
- JetBrains MCP Server (by JetBrains)
- Grafana MCP Server (by Grafana)
