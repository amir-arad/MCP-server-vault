# TypeScript

MCP servers implemented using the TypeScript programming language.

## Description

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It adds static type definitions to enhance code quality and understandability. Many MCP servers are built with TypeScript due to its robust type system, excellent developer experience, and seamless integration with JavaScript ecosystems. TypeScript is particularly prevalent in web-based and Node.js MCP implementations.

## Characteristics

- Static typing with JavaScript runtime compatibility
- Modern ECMAScript features support
- Excellent tooling and IDE integration
- Strong community and ecosystem
- First-class support for asynchronous programming
- Gradual typing system allows incremental adoption
- Broad framework compatibility
