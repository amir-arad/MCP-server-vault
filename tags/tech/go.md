# Go

MCP servers implemented using the Go programming language.

## Description

Go (or Golang) is a statically-typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It combines memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Many MCP servers are written in Go due to its performance, simplicity, and strong standard library, making it well-suited for building efficient network services.

## Characteristics

- Strong performance for I/O-bound operations
- Low memory footprint
- Native concurrency through goroutines
- Straightforward deployment (single binary)
- Built-in cross-compilation
- Strong standard library for networking
- Growing ecosystem of libraries
